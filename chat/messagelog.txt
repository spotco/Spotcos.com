(03-30 10:30)Mark|?|Kevin said he helped make some of your games (I am in his class at school). Is it true?
(03-30 10:31)Mark|?|that message above not displaying right.
(03-30 10:31)Mark|?|Did kevin lee help make any of your games?
(04-01 6:20)spotco|?|yeah, he made a few levels -- try them out!
(04-01 10:31)Mark|?|I also love javascript. check out my game: markasoftware.getenjoyment.net
(04-01 10:37)|?|
(04-02 6:08)spotco|?|pretty cool, I made a js psedo-game once (check out facemii in projects)
(04-02 6:08)spotco|?|also this chat thing which looks like it's failing pretty hard
(04-04 10:43)Mark|?|I could make a chat, as I also know php and made a really lame chat at markasoftware.getenjoyment.net/testing/chatter.html. It uses html, javascript (for ajax) and php.
(04-04 10:43)Mark|?|It didn't display the whole above msg!
(04-04 10:44)Mark|?|can't do facemii, I don't have Facebook account
(04-05 2:00)spotco|?|yeah, I think I break up strings here on the shift+9, probably a bad choice. Made this a long time ago, wasn't as smart back then.
(04-05 10:51)Mark|?|just reprogram the chatter!
(04-09 9:52)Mark|?|On jumpdiecreate, it says my level name is too short when its in range!
(04-11 5:15)spotco|?|nice, I played your game too and it's pretty cool. I'll check out the level when I have time. You should check out actionscript though, it's very similar to javascript!
(04-11 5:41)spotco|?|and much easier to make cool games with. I'm super pro at it now after working on goober for so long.

(05-18 10:55)Value of Radio Button|?|Hmmmm.... Is there anyone online?
(05-21 5:21)spotco|?|it has a more complete standard library {sound, vector graphics, userinput}, and isn't nearly as dependent on browser as making something in html5
(05-21 5:22)spotco|?|also the syntax is a bastard child of java and javascript, if youre into that
(05-22 10:35)Mark|?|Does actionscript require flash?
(05-30 6:55)spotco|?|yeah it requires the flash plugin
(05-30 7:54)spotco|?|lol also for anyone reading it fixed the ()()))()() problem with this

(10-20 10:57)|?|we found a bunch of solutions on scribd but they only show the work, there isn't an explanation to go along with it. which is required by our professor, so fml. but I recommend scribd, just search for tipler 6th edition chapter whatever and you should be able to find it :)
