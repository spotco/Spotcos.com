Work on the iOS runner game continues, managed to get quite a bit of work done over break (less so since classes have started again). Did a ton of improvements to the AutoLevel (think of it as the infinite part of infinite runner) system, optimizations (check out my FUQQIN BEYOND EXPERT opengl optimization right there <a href="https://github.com/spotco/GOstritch/blob/master/Classes/BatchDraw.m">BatchDraw</a>) and added a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzLz0t1z_lk">first boss</a> to the game. More recently, added soundeffects (made myself in sfxr, NOT final :)), and various animations/fixes. Latest video (at time of writing) here:

The game engine's basically complete, but now the real hard part begins. I need to actually MAKE the game with all the content. This basically comes down to grinding out about 50 or so level sections for the infinite mode, which I never realised would be so time consuming. I'm going to try to keep on a schedule of 2 level sections every day from today on, but that's going to be approximately 2 hours every day doing that. That's the reason why I'm still trying to get someone to work, but it looks like nobody's interested in game development :(. And here I thought it was going to be smooth going after I got the physics figured out...

Also, decided on a (probably) final title for the game. <b>SPEEDY PUPS</b><br/>
(and here's a logo)

So the idea here was that all the popular games follow a certain ADJECTIVE NOUN pattern. Tiny <i>Wings</i>. Angry <i>Birds</i>. See it? I wanted the title of the game to reflect this, so we chose our adjectives and nouns very carefully (this is a joke, by the way). In all seriousness, I was trying to go for a Sonic-like feeling with the logo. IMO, it still looks a little...bland. It'll have to have a bit more work, but I think it's a start. The game's still coming out sometime next year at this current rate of progress :)

A couple of other random fun things updated. I decided I wanted to write more, so I added a review section to the site. You can read my somewhat embarassing opinions on the latest vidya+anime I play/watch. In addition, also made <a href="https://github.com/spotco/GamePanel">GamePanel</a>, a simple game library based on marty's drawingpanel. I showed it to my section (along with a demo for a simple snake game), and I think they liked it. Easy enough to learn and make something in 1 hour. (I know I would have killed for this when I was learning programming :)). Finally, got a summer internship. GOING 2 SF BBBBBBBB~

<i>Last bit, which I thought was funny. The site's been getting a lot of traffic, but not the good kind. Apparently all of the music I host has been scraped and is being linked to in all the mp3 search sites. Might need to do something about that...</i>
