	Entered the <a href="http://itch.io/jam/cyberpunk-jam">Cyberpunk Game Jam</a> with our game, <a href="http://spotco.itch.io/window-cleaner---the-love-story">WINDOW CLEANER - The love story</a>.<br/><br/> Really satisfied with how the game turned out (managed to put in everything we wanted). It was a reach stretch though (the weekend before the deadline, we were at about 20% programming done and 5% of the art). Shoutouts to Ciera, Yasu, Donovan and Joshua for their work.<br/><br/>
	I'm planning to play just about every working entry to the jam, and post some of my favorites here. Stay tuned!
