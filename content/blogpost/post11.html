	Entered the <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/">Ludum Dare 29</a> (theme: Beneath the Surface) with my game, <a href="http://spotco.itch.io/window-cleaner---the-love-story">Maniac Pengmaku!</a>.

	Pretty satisfied with how this turned out. I started a few hours late with absolutely no idea what I was gonna do (and not much painting practice since several years). With this one, I tried to focus more on gameplay (since I do remember the last one, <a href="http://spotco.itch.io/window-cleaner">Window Cleaner</a>, I was focused more on story/etc and got criticism for that). Turned out really fun to play, and a good opportunity to learn <a href="http://haxe.org/">Haxe</a> and <a href="http://haxeflixel.com/">Haxeflixel</a>. Would like to do port to mobile whenever I get the time.

	Played a whole lot of other Ludum Dare entries (really liked their system for incentivizing submitters to rate), so here's a few of my favorites.

	<b>Liked:</b> By far and away my favorite out of all that I played. So much ambition (and polish) for a 48 hour game, and executed super well. Highlights are the RPG-esque upgrade system (that keep you interested for the whole game), and really amazing graphics &amp; animations. Also the voice acting is super cute, I gotta get more of that in my games :)<br/>
	<b>Disliked:</b> Starts off (before you have all your upgrades) pretty slow and a little frustrating. You'll need to grind a bit before taking on the first boss, then your powerlevel snowballs from there. My first run took around 30-40mins (which is huge for a gamejam game), but really wish there was more of it!

	<b>Liked:</b> Like Pikmin, but super simplified (with blocky canvas.drawrect graphics). Super creative idea, and pretty fun to play. Ending also makes me cry errytime.<br/>
<b>Disliked:</b> Not too challenging (your pikmins never stop spawning) and pretty short. But, it WAS a gamejam game so that last bit can be forgiven.

			<p>
<b>Liked:</b> Played a couple of RTS-like games, and this one was my favorite. Decently challenging (had to restart a few times before I had a good setup going), and really great art and sound. Will take a bit of micro to beat, though once you know what you're doing the the game will end pretty quickly. Also a really creative idea, with complex mechanics that are well explained.<br/>
<b>Disliked:</b> Too short (no fault here), and the win-condition is really luck based (either your radars find the artifacts or they don't).

			<h2><a href="http://jonochrome.itch.io/scary-ugly-face">Damn Scouts</a></h2>
			<p>
<b>Liked:</b> Really really cute art and setting. Funny too, since you need to find various ways to kill the scouts (and they always have a super cute  death animation). 
<br/><b>Disliked:</b> One of those indie platformer/puzzle games without much gameplay (this one's more on the puzzle side). Had some trouble (leading to frustration) figuring out how to kill the last scout, ended up solving it by running around pressing the "use" button on the whole map.

	I'm trying to reach the top 20 in games rated, so I'll play more and post them if one really catches my imagination. LD has been lots of fun, totally gonna do it again (hopefully with an artist though :))
