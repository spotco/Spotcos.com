		"I was super pumped for this. I waited months for a camrip and sub. I reread the whole eva manga (you know it STILL isn't finished yet, it's cut off right around halfway through the EoE movie). But god damn it did not help that the camrip was filmed by Shakey McPointDirectlyAwayFromScreen himself. But onto the movie itself.",
		"So it opens up with some random combat scenes with the tsundere and mari (who still hasn't had characterization for shit, might as well have replaced her entirely) and shinji waking up and generally not knowing what the fuck is going on. Wait, which timeline were the movies following and what happened in the last movie? Didn't touji just die and THEHAPPENING just begin? Anyway, everyone's angry at him, misato's got a nice uniform and tsundere's got an eyepatch. Then, piano with Kaworu for 45mins which leads to some synchronized 2pilots1eva shit (a shitty imitation of the shinji/asuka dance battle angel), ITSHAPPENINGv2.0 (5th impact?). The end, everyone walks off into the sunset of a post-apocalyptic neo-tokyo.",
		"The big problem here was a general lack of explanation. 95% of NERV is now fighting against Evas in a fleet of flying battleships powered by the core of Eva 1. Gendo is now cyclops from Xmen and is able to build Evas alone in the ruins of NERV Hq. Kaworu takes off Shinji's kill collar and PUTS IT ON HIMSELF FOR NO REASON. Finally, HAPPENINGDEVICE was literally down a empty tunnel the last 15 years and surprise surprise everyone shows up for the final showdown. It was just hard to really get into something with so many obvious inconsistencies. Eva's strong suit wasn't even plot, but fanservice-y character development. The only development anyone got in this film was the homosex shota-tastic piano playing relationship between kaworu and shinji.",
		"They introduced a shit ton of new characters (touji's sister, annoying boat operator, grizzled nerv veteran) without the tiniest bit of characterization, they might as well have not existed. This whole film might have well not existed. If you want to do EVA fanservice, you need to go back to the basics. That means highschool, shinji in misato's apartment, romantic comedy between shinji and asuka, and tfwfeelio with rei. Dissapointment overall, might as well read the manga again. "

		"Making progress on my backlog. I bought this game a year or so ago for cheap at Fry's because it looked like JRPG-ish. The game itself a side-scrolling metroidvania, though barely at that. If you were expecting a super metroid style collect powerups unlock colored doors, you'll be in for dissapointment. There's literally 20 or so different rooms, copy and pasted in every area. Just from looking at map you'd think it was some sort of puzzle filled lots-o-backtracking overworld, but nope all you'll find are empty desolate screens filled with useless items and random encounters",
		"Good points: combat was fun, though spammy and at times repetetive. Did I mention there were random encounters? The combat really DID make you feel like a ninja though. I was dashing around air-comboing enemies like nobody's business. Finally, I didn't know you could use sword abilities until my second playthrough, lol. (It's one of those beat multiple times to see endings games. You DO get a new story and different bosses, but it's basically playing the same game twice). Also, music is pretty good. It's Hitoshi Sakamoto and Basiscape (they're doing Opoona too which is next). Some of it is classic Sakamoto-ambient-where's-the-melody orchestra stuff, but there's some really great field to battle transition themes. <a href=''>OST (it was kinda hard to find!) was gotten</a>. Art was good too. But you'll be getting tired of it after all these empty rooms",
		"Final point: this game was REALLY japanese. Like rice rice konichiwa u rike beybladeo japanese. The story's basically something the lines of kisuke-chan no watashi wants to tengu wa muramasa ne, but monohime-sama won't anata desu mt fuji raiku amaterasu. And there were hotsprings scenes, and they were fanservice-y as shit. Still enjoyed them though."

		"I like JRPG, I like Square Enix so I was expecting something good. Problems? The Disney aspect was a gimmick. The bulk story consists of watching 20min reenactions of ``classic'' movies. Maybe I would have had a stronger emotional response if I was in the disney-princess demographic, but it's damn hard to care about a character you'll never see again after a boss battle or two. ",
		"Overall it lacked cohesion, it didn't feel as if you're adventuring in a huge JRPG world but instead a series of unrelated themed Zelda dungeon rooms. The Nomura-belts-and-zippers story holding everything together wasn't any better. Brief summary: <i>ANCIENT DARKNESS AWAKENS, YOUR CHOSEN ONE</i>. What felt most lacking was any sense of exposition. Did I mention there were Final Fantasy characters just randomly thrown about? I'm guessing that was supposed to get a <b>GIGGLESQUEE CLOUD MY BISHIE~~!!XDDD</b> kind of reaction, but they could have just as easily been replaced with something like <b>ORIGINAL</b> characters.",
		"Good points: combat was passable (standard hack and slash with shitty camera), and actually somewhat fun+challenging in some of the boss difficulty spikes (notably final boss, which took several hours). But the majority of the game spent fighting trash mobs is just spamming x and rolling like it's monster hunter (which is still a step above turn based random encounters). <a href='http://spotcos.com/misc/music/kingdom%20hearts/'>Other good bit: music.

		"Started watching because I saw pictures of the little sister character. Why is she so perfect (design wise)? Surprisingly, I didn't really think her waifu tier once I got into the anime. If you're into getting dominated by tsundere girls (AKA ASUKAFAG) she'll probably be right up your alley. The premise itself is fairly unbelievable and you'll need to hold on tight to your suspension-of-disbelief here. Basically, imagine if Asuka was your little sister and was secretly into hentai/etc. Hey I used to play those when I was 12 too :D Also you're like Shinji in that you essentially have no personality and EVERY girl was into you. Damn, I really want to watch Eva 3.0 :(",
		"The anime itself is like a meta-anime about animes and anime-otaku culture, which I think would be pretty clever and meta if I was really into that kind of thing (I only have ONE anime figure). Some of the dialogue and scenarios were a little cringeworthy, like the little sister writing a novel that becomes famous and gets an anime, or the making an eroge game for a contest in one week (she says she can actually write 8kbs of text per second, if I could do that I'd probably have written a lot more of these shitty reviews by now). But, there are equally many legitimately funny and SQUEE~~!! inducing moments.",
		"With this kind of anime it's usually customary to pick a favorite girl or ``WAIFU''. There's the obvious one, the tsunder titular little sister. But, the authors get tired of her halfway through and focuses the show on other characters before KILLING HER OFF WITH AMERICA. Her goth-loli friend is the clear favorite of the show (just based on the amount fanservice-y material you get). She should please any Reifag, they're both deep mysterious cold 4deep5u types. Personally I didn't have the waifu connection which may have hampered my enjoyment of this anime. <a href='http://spotcos.com/misc/music/Ore%20no%20Imouto%20ga%20Konna%20ni%20Kawaii%20Wake%20ga%20Nai%20Original%20Soundtrack/'>OST had some catchy shit too, DAT MOESHIT.</a>"]

I killed The End with a shotgun to the face. I beat the boss using sniper rifles and claymores, and while it was pretty funny seeing her run straight into them, it just didn't feel...canon. Also, did anyone else have trouble doing cool moves with CQC? I'd constantly ``accidentally'' throat-gouge by pressing circle too hard. I'M SORRY GAME IM NERVOUS.

His name: Yasunori Mitsuda. For the record, this is not to undermine the amazing works of other incredibly talented vidcon composers such as Uematsu-san or Sakuraba-san, but to highlight the unique, almost celto-tropic music (the word music is an understatement) that Yasunori Mitsuda has been composing for years.</i>",
		"This is the statement of a true videogame connoisseur (and if you agree, you may be one too). I always thought I was the only person to ever compulsively get video game OSTs after playing. The creators and I, we were like kindred spirits. We understand that fine videogames are like fine wine: you must savor every part of it (and that anything made in japan is inherently better). The game itself is a Paper Mario-like JRPG (the best genre), and features some 4chan-tastic humor. U HAVE ASPBURGERS. So basically, it's like /v/ the game.",
