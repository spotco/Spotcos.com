		"I like JRPG, I like Square Enix so I was expecting the best. But it never got good. Problems? The Disney aspect was a gimmick. The bulk story consists of watching 20min reenactions of ``classic'' movies. Maybe I would have had a stronger emotional response if I was in the disney-princess demographic, but it's damn hard to care about a character you'll never see again after a boss battle or two. ",
		"Overall it lacked cohesion, it didn't feel as if you're adventuring in a huge JRPG world but instead a series of unrelated themed Zelda dungeon rooms. The Nomura-belts-and-zippers story holding everything together wasn't any better. Brief summary: <i>ANCIENT DARKNESS AWAKENS, YOUR CHOSEN ONE</i>. What felt most lacking was any sense of exposition. Did I mention there were Final Fantasy characters just randomly thrown about? I'm guessing that was supposed to get a <b>GIGGLESQUEE CLOUD MY BISHIE~~!!XDDD</b> kind of reaction, but they could have just as easily been replaced with something like <b>ORIGINAL</b> characters.",
		"Apparently (or so I've read on gamefaqs) the story of KH1 was the best, and only gets worse in the sequels. So, just judging on this game I wouldn't be a fan.",
		"Good points: combat was passable (standard hack and slash with shitty camera), and actually somewhat fun+challenging in some of the boss difficulty spikes (notably final boss, which took several hours). But the majority of the game spent fighting trash mobs is just spamming x and rolling like it's monster hunter (which is still a step above turn based random encounters). Other good bit: music. Nothing too amazing, but hey yoko shinomura can do no wrong. "
